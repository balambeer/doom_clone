FEATURES TO ADD?

Implementation:
- Change the sprite handling to use rectangles: find the bottom of the sprite (where it is on the ground). SKIP: dwaring sprites would not be compatible with the rest of the drawing, and I don't want to change that now.
- Add ability to look up/down slightly
- Do I need to do garbage collection myself?

Gameplay:
- Random map generation
- Multiple enemy types
- Object pickup?

Building a library:
- Rectangle collisions for building buttons? Write a button class?
